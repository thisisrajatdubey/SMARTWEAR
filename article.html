    A smartwatch is a wearable computing device that closely resembles
    a wristwatch or other time-keeping device.
    The watch becomes a wireless Bluetooth adaptor.
    capable of extending the capabilities of the wearer's smartphone to
    the watch.
    Smartwatch is a wearable computer in the form of a watch;
    modern smartwatches provide a local touchscreen interface for
    daily use, while an associated smartphone app provides for management and
    telemetry (such as long-term biomonitoring). While early models could perform
    basic tasks, such as calculations, digital time telling, translations, and game-playing,
    2010s smartwatches have more  general functionality closer to smartphones, including mobile
    apps, a mobile operating system and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function
    as portable media players, with FM radio and playback of digital audio and video files via a
    Bluetooth headset. Some models, called watch phones (or vice versa), have mobile cellular
    functionality like making calls.
